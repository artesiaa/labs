Download the swap.c base code
Create a program that reads two numbers and swaps them
Create two functions to read and swap the variable values. 
Look for the function comments in the base code! Write your functions underneath the comments, based on the description
Donâ€™t forget to add the prototypes
Call those functions in the appropriate order
Print out the memory addresses you are manipulating! In total you need to print 6 memory addresses
2 in main, showing the original location
2 in swap, showing which memory locations you are manipulating
2 in read, showing to which memory locations you are storing the input
In the mini report, include the following answer to the question:
What conclusion can you make based on those memory addresses printed in different functions?

 * Parameters:     a - int pointer, first value
